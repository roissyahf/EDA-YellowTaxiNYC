# Basic Exploratory Data Analysis: Yellow Taxi New York City April 2022
This mini project is part of independent learning progress i made. 

## Mini Project Intro

## Mini Project Description
Instead solving any business problem, i choose to extract meaningful insight from raw data set. The data set obtained from Pacmann AI Mini Course entitled "Intro to Data and Analytics".

In this mini project, i focus answering questions to fulfill my curiosity.
